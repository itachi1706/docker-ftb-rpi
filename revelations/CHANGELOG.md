    - Added a block blacklist for rockets, fixing a rocket duplication bug.
    - Changed the names of crystal blocks, in order to avoid confusion with actual crafting items from other mods.
    - Moved the Space Station spawn height one block below, as to avoid a small moment of player suffocation on respawn.

- Exchangers by Jacky1356400 (2.6.2 > 2.7)

    - Rewrote the block detection algorithm, it now works a lot better with walls.

- Immersive Engineering by BluSunrize (0.12-76 > 0.12-77)
    - Various changes to the wiring system:
    - Uninsulated energy wires cause damage now.
    - Wires don't need a clear line-of-sight, but a clear path along the wire as it is rendered.
    - Placing blocks that obstruct wires will cause the wire to break/drop.
    - The skyhook can attach to the middle of connections, rather than just the endpoints.
    - Added a feedthrough insulator as a way to get wires through walls.
    - Addons using wires will have to adapt to these changes!
    - IE now prints a message to chat if Java 8 update 25 is used, since it causes unfixable crashes.

    - Added transfer addons that can pull and push items and fluids.
    - Added a config option for the petrified fuel generator, to change only for how much a fuel burns based in its burn time (Resetting the Petrified Fuel Generator config will show you a better description of the config options, if it doesn't change).
    - Added a config option to make the Fluid pump not replace fluid with cobblestone.
    - Added Russian translation.
    - Added a config option to increase the range of tree checking.

- The Lost Cities by McJty (1.0.2 > 2.0.0)
    - New landscape types:
        - Floating: this landscape type generates floating islands on which cities (buildings and streets) can generate. This landscape type is likely not suitable for general overworld play because villages and strongholds are not generated by default. This profile can be useful to set as a type for the Lost City dimension or for specialized packs.
        - Cavern: a nether-like world going up to 128 with bedrock on top. Cities generate in big caverns. This type of map is very dark and dangerous but otherwise useful as a replacement for the overworld. Good luck surviving the first days though.
        - Space: in this landscape type there are big spheres that generate through the world. These spheres can contain cities (but not always) and can optionally be connected with a monorail system. The landscape outside the spheres can be configured as well. There are three example profiles using this landscape type:
        - biosphere: spheres containing jungles and cities and the outside world a wasteland with very badly damaged and ruined cities.
        - space: spheres floating in the void connected with monorails.
        - waterbubbles: spheres floating in a huge ocean connected with monorails.
    - New configuration possibilities:
        - It is now possible to completely disable highways and railways.
        - There are a few new client side configs for fog density, color and the height of the horizon. These configs only work if the client has Lost Cities installed as well.
        - Worlds using 'space' landscape type have an optional secondary profile that is used for the outside. That way the landscape in the spheres can be totally different (including different biomes) from the landscape outside.
        - New configuration options to avoid foliage of all types. You can now avoid mushrooms, flowers, trees, and so on.
        - New configuration option to avoid the vanilla fossil generation. Useful for void type worlds.
        - Supports for bridges and highways are optional and disabled in void style worlds.
    - New asset system options:
        - The 'dontconnect' meta flag for parts will now also avoid generating doorways for floors that are adjacent to a street outside section or the top of an adjacent building.
        - It is possible to define predefined spheres and disable the automatic generation of spheres. Useful for modpack makers. Every predefined sphere can have a different set of biomes.
        - New 'isbuilding', 'issphere', and 'inbiome' conditions. These conditions can be used (for example) to control loot. Using this you can make sure that loot in the wasteland is different from loot in the spheres.
        - It is now possible to use loot tables on dispeners, hoppers, shulker boxes as well as chests.
        - It is now possible to use torches or light sources from other mods and have Lost City orient them correctly based on where they are placed.
        - Added the ability to specify local named palettes in parts now.
        - Cleanup the palette a bit. All rails are now in a separate palette. Keep this in mind if you were using those in custom assets.
        - New 'nowater' boolean metadata for parts to make sure the ~ (air/water) never generates water even if under waterlevel. Used to avoid water in monorail system.
    - Spawns and teleportation:
        - It is now possible to make sure that players spawn in a certain biome, in a certain predefined bity or in a certain predefined sphere.
        - When spawning in a void type world Lost Cities will make sure the player spawns on solid ground.
        - When teleporting to a void type Lost City world (using the bed+skulls system) Lost Cities will find a valid spot to teleport too. In addition Lost Cities will teleport the player back to a spawn bed if it can find one.
    - Other changes:
        - Nicer profile selection gui. You can now see a small preview of the world you are about to create as well as a more verbose description.
        - Better error handling in case chunk generation causes a crash (can be caused by invalid configuration). You get a log entry telling what chunk caused the problem and some information about that chunk.
        - The API has been expanded with new support for the spheres.
        - Added more optional torches to park parts to ensure that the new dark level types (like cavern) are a bit more playable.

- Thut's Elevators by Thutmose (6.0.10 > 6.0.11)
- UniDict by WanionCane (1.9b > 2.1)
    - Implemented CraftTweaker support:
    - Example:
    - mods.unidict.api.newShapedRecipeTemplate(String outputKind, int outputSize, String[][] shape);
    - mods.unidict.api.newShapelessRecipeTemplate(String outpuKind, int outputSize, String[] inputs);
    - mods.unidict.removalByKind.crafting(String kindName);
    - The first two commands are for creating all the recipes for a given kind, per example, if you want change all you gear recipe to have a different shape, then now you don't need to create one by one.
    - The last command will be used to remove recipes for a given kind, if you pass it the argument "block", then it will remove all the recipes for blocks, like iron block, copper block, gold block, and etc... (I will expand this on the future for mod machines).
    - For more informations about CraftTweaker support, check out here.
    - Added a config option to blacklist some ItemStacks in Unification.
    - Added a new RemoveByKind CT command, furnace.
    - Added the method addItemStackToBlackList to UniDictAPI, this will allow modders to "blacklist" ItemStacks directly.
    - Added an optional parameter String[] resourceKindWhiteList for the CT commands mods.unidict.removalByKind,get("crafting") and mods.unidict.removalByKind,get("furnace"). Is is basically a filter, that it will remove recipes only when the resource contains the given "kinds".
    - There are several other improvements on the source code, like resource gathering.
    - Now resource gathering is made on init (this will need some testing in order to see if there are no negative effects.).
    - Now you can pass null values (for the shape)for the CraftTweaker command mods.unidict.api.newShapedRecipeTemplate() without crashing.
    - Changed how to use the RemovalByKind CT Command:
    - now it is needed to "get" the wanted RemovalByKind.
    - Usage:
    - val removalByKind = mods.unidict.removalByKind.get("removalByKindName")
    - This will return the wanted RemovalByKind instance, as long you passed it a valid value.
    - Currently the valid values are ("crafting", "furnace")
    - Added another RemovalByKind, the "furnace"
    - It works exactly as the "crafting" variant, but for the furnace.
    - After getting the RemovalByKind instance, in order to use, use the "remove" method, it uses the same arguments as before.
    - It isn't required to store the "instance" in a val, but if you want to use it several times, it is better.
- XNet by MCJty (1.6.0 > 1.6.4)
    - Implemented extract mode for item channels: first (like it was in the past), random slot, or round robin.
    - Doubled the speed of item connectors (5 ticks per operation for advanced and 10 ticks per operation for normal).
    - New version of the redstone proxy block that can do block updates.
    - The controller GUI will sort connected blocks based on block name.
    - Implemented tooltips for the filtered items in item connectors.
    - Fixed a bug in handling of old connectors for XNet causing lots of log spam and loss of TPS.
    - The mod now uses McJtyLib's way to render tooltips for items in filter.
    - Implemented a new API so that other mods can 'connect' their blocks to XNet connectors.
    - Fixed a crash that could occur in item channels.
    - `Improved how 'random' works. It will now really select evenly among all non-empty input slots.

## Configuration Changes
- Just Enough Items (JEI)
    - Hid the Sickles from Extra Utilities 2 from the inventory item list, which have their recipes disabled (to prevent them overlapping with the ones from Thermal Foundation).
    - Increased the amount of subtypes an item must have before being automatically hidden from JEI's list (up from 300 to 500).

## Recipe Changes
- Changed the recipe for Crackers (from Pam's Harvestcraft)
    - It's now a shapeless recipe, which requires 2 Cracker.
    - This fixes a recipe overlap with Pretzels sharing the old recipe.
    - This tweak should be undone once HC fixes it on its end.

    - It now requires 4 wood slabs surrounding a wooden plank.
    - This fixes a recipe overlap with the Wood Gear from Tesla Core Lib.
